  MLX90393 magnetic sensor input driver

  This driver reads magnetic field data from the MLX90393 sensor via I2C
  and generates mouse input events. It supports two states based on Z-axis
  threshold detection and reports relative movement and button press events.

  Example usage:
    mlx90393_input: mlx90393-input {
      compatible = "melexis,mlx90393-input";
      reg = <0x0C>;
      polling-interval-ms = <10>;
      z-press-threshold = <50>;
      z-hysteresis = <10>;
    };

compatible: "melexis,mlx90393-input"

include: [base.yaml, i2c-device.yaml]

properties:
  polling-interval-ms:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      Sensor reading interval in milliseconds.
      Affects responsiveness vs power consumption.

  z-press-threshold:
    type: int
    default: 50
    description: |
      Z-axis threshold value for press detection.
      Values above this threshold trigger pressed state.

  z-hysteresis:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      Z-axis hysteresis value to prevent state oscillation.
      Press state is released when Z falls below (threshold - hysteresis).


  deadzone-x:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: X-axis deadzone to filter small movements.

  deadzone-y:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: Y-axis deadzone to filter small movements.

  deadzone-z:
    type: int
    default: 5
    description: Z-axis deadzone to filter small movements.

  movement-threshold:
    type: int
    default: 20
    description: |
      Movement detection threshold for auto-calibration.
      Movement below this value is considered stationary.

  auto-calibration-timeout-s:
    type: int
    default: 30
    description: |
      Auto-calibration timeout in seconds.
      Calibration occurs after this period of no movement.

  bindings:
    type: phandles
    required: true
    description: |
      List of two behavior bindings: [normal-binding, pressed-binding].
      First binding is for normal state (Z-axis below threshold).
      Second binding is for pressed state (Z-axis above threshold).
